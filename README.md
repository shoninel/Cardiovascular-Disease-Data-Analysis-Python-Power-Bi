# Cardiovascular Diseases Data Analysis(Python,Power Bi)

## Problem Statement:
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. To identify the causes and to develop a system to predict heart attack in an effective manner is necessary. Analyse and create a dashboard to demonstrate the relationship between factors and CVD

## Dataset used:
- <a href="https://github.com/shoninel/Cardiovascular-Disease-Data-Analysis-Python-Power-Bi/blob/main/data.xlsx"> Dataset</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/shoninel/Cardiovascular-Disease-Data-Analysis-Python-Power-Bi/blob/main/variable%20description.xlsx"> Variable Description:</a>

## Steps Involved:
- Performed preliminary data inspection and report the findings as the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates etc.
- Based on the findings,removed duplicates (if any) , treat missing values using appropriate strategy.
- Used Python pandas to clean and preprocess the data
- plotted the variable relations and distribution using python libraries such as matplotlib ,seaborn etc
